= fbx_direct, a low-level FBX parser for Rust

fbx_direct is an FBX library for Rust programming language.
It is heavily inspired by link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/StAX[Java Streaming API for XML (StAX)] and link:https://github.com/netvl/xml-rs[xml-rs].

This library currently contains only Binary FBX event reader and writer like xml-rs.
